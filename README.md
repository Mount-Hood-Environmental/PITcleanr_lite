`PITcleanr_lite` is intended as a user-friendly, stand-alone group of R functions and scripts that leverages functionality and is a companion to the `PITcleanr` R package located [here](https://github.com/KevinSee/PITcleanr). `PITcleanr_lite` is designed to "compress" large, sometimes unwieldy PIT-tag observation datasets for a given list of PIT-tagged fish into observation records and capture histories that are more manageable to aid in fisheries analyses. PITcleanr_lite accommodates observation data downloaded from either the Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System([PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org/)) or the Biomark, Inc. BioLogic<sup>TM</sup> web portal located [here](https://data3.biomark.com/). PTAGIS is the centralized database for PIT-tagged fish in the Columbia River basin and houses observation data for many of the more permanent PIT-tag arrays located throughout the region. However, PTAGIS does not contain most observation data from either 1) observation sites outside of the Columbia River basin or 2) temporary or project-specific detection sites (e.g., litz cords). These observations can instead be found in the BioLogic<sup>TM</sup> database and web portal, at least for arrays and infrastructure installed by Biomark, Inc.
